The company "Alpha Robotics" recently announced a new product called the "Domestic Assistant Bot 5000" (DAB-5000). The bot is designed for general household cleaning and basic organizing tasks.
Key Specifications:
Release Date: November 15, 2025
Price: $1,200 USD
Battery Life: 4 hours of continuous use
Color Options: White, Black, Silver
Alpha Robotics CEO, Dr. Evelyn Reed, stated in a press release that the DAB-5000 is their most anticipated product of the year, emphasizing its advanced navigation system. The main competitor is the older "CleanerBot X1" model from Beta Corp, which only offers a 2-hour battery life and is priced at $900.
Beta Corp's older model is cheaper but lacks the advanced obstacle avoidance technology present in the DAB-5000. Alpha Robotics expects to capture a significant market share in the smart home appliance sector with this launch.
